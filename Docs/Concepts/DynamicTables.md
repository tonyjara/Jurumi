# Dynamic Tables

## Concept

Dynamic table is a component that takes data and column information and provides features to filter, sort, edit and access the data.

## Features

1. Table options: Table options is an array with options that get rendered on the top right corner of the file with a 3 dot icon. The label and the click handler are the props that need to be provided.

2. Global or local filtering: Global filtering means that when active, if the user presses on the column header, the list will be sorted based on the column id in the scope of the whole database.
   When global is inactive, the scope changes to only the current rendered list.
