#Money Balances

Inside Jurumi there are certain tables in the database that can hold money balances. These tables hold transactions, through those transactions they can determine the current balance that they have. Depending on the transaction TYPE we can see what transaction affects which table. 

Transaction types:
  MEMBERSHIP_PAYMENT
  PROJECT_IMBURSEMENT
  EXPENSE_RETURN
  COST_CATEGORY -- This is the only one that doesn't directly affect a money account
  MONEY_ACCOUNT
  MONEY_ACCOUNT_IMBURSEMENT
  OFFSET

These are all the tables in the databse that can hold balances

1 - MoneyAccounts
2 - CostCategories 
3 - Projects



## Cost CostCategories

Cost categories are affected only when EXPENSE_RETURN is used. This is because the money is not going to a specific account, but rather to a category.
Expense reports with no cost category will no create transactions.


## Project imbursements

They keep track of how much money has been received by a project. This is done by adding the amount to the project's balance. This is done by using the PROJECT_IMBURSEMENT transaction type.
