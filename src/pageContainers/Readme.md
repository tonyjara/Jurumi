# Folder to store files used as pages's index

## Why?

Nextjs forces us to use the index.tsx name to use the folder name as route. This makes finding files increasingly difficult as time goes on. So instead I decided to implement this Pattern.

Name of file => [Descriptive name] . [path] . [subpath]
