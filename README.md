# JURUMI

Jurumi is a web platform to manage non-profit's projects, keep track of expenses and soon memberships. As a software developers we can hace a significant impact in conservation. This software is meant for non-profits in Paraguay.

## Why Jurumi?

Paaraguay being so small and having such different needs as other countries it lacks the variety of offers for this kind of software, having not found a solution that fits are needs and pays enough attention to the problems we're trying to solve locally we decided to build Jurumi.

## Who's behind Jurumi?

Jurumi became a reality thanks to funding provided by [OPADES](https:///opades.org.py), I'm currently the only engineer involved in the project, I open source this project so that anyone interested can get involve.
